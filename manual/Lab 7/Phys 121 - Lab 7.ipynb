    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1820, the Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted observed that when he placed a compass near a current-carrying wire, the compass needle was deflected. This hinted towards a deep connection between electricity and magnetism, which would be vigourously investigated through the rest of the 19th century. The theory of **electromagnetism** is the result of that work. Its mathematical basis was completed by Maxwell in 1865 and verified experimentally by Hertz in the late 1880s and 90s.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you may have learned in class about two important results in electromagnetism - **Faraday's law** and **Ampère's law**. Forgoing mathematical precision, the implications of these laws can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "* **Faraday's law**: a time-varying magnetic flux passing through a closed conducting loop will generate an electric current\n",
    "* **Ampère's law**: an electric current will generate a magnetic field, which forms a closed loop around the current\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the *many* direct applications of these laws are\n",
    "* **electrical generators**: mechanical energy (from combustion, movement of water over turbines, pressurized steam, etc.) is converted to electrical energy by rotating conducting loops of wire through a housing of stationary magnets, generating a current according to Faraday's law\n",
    "* **microphones**: sound waves cause vibrations in a small magnetic diaphragm, generating a current in a nearby coil with the *same* frequency content as the sound waves\n",
    "* **loudspeakers**: precisely the opposite of a microphone - a time-varying current through a loop creates a time-varying magnetic feild according to Ampère's law. This field causes a magnetized diaphragm to oscillate, which in turn vibrates the air, producing sound waves with the same frequency content as the electrical signal\n",
    "* **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: atomic nuclii have intrinsic magnetic moments. Strong magnetic fields perturb nuclii in the body, generating characteristic electromagnetic signals which can be used to construct a 3D map of a patient's body. This requires strong magnetic fields, and the most common form of MRI machine used today creates these fields with liquid helium cooled superconducting electromagnets\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, you will be using an application of **Ampère's law** to measure the local magnetic field due to the earth. You will investigate **Faraday's law** next week in Lab 8.\n",
