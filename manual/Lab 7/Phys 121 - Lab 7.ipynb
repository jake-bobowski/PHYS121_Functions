    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1820, the Danish physicist Hans Christian Ørsted observed that a compass needle would be deflected when the compass was placed near a current-carrying wire. This hinted towards a deep connection between electricity and magnetism, which would be vigourously investigated through the rest of the 19th century. Described mathematically by Maxwell in 1965 and verified experimentally by Hertz in the late 1880s and 90s, the theory of **electromagnetism** is the result of that work.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you may have learned in class about two important results in electromagnetism - **Faraday's law** and **Ampère's law**. Forgoing mathematical precision, the implications of these laws can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "* **Faraday's law**: a time-varying magnetic flux passing through a closed conducting loop will generate an electric current\n",
    "* **Ampère's law**: an electric current will generate a magnetic field, which forms a closed loop around the current\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the *many* direct applications of these laws are\n",
    "* **electrical generators**: mechanical energy (from combustion, movement of water over turbines, pressurized steam, etc.) is converted to electrical energy by rotating a conducting coil through a magnetic field, generating a current according to Faraday's law\n",
    "* **microphones**: sound waves cause vibrations in a small magnetic diaphragm, generating a current in a nearby coil with the *same* frequency content as the sound waves\n",
    "* **loudspeakers**: precisely the opposite of a microphone - a time-varying current through a loop creates a time-varying magnetic feild according to Ampère's law. This field causes a magnetized diaphragm to oscillate, which in turn vibrates the air, producing sound waves with the same frequency content as the electrical signal\n",
    "* **magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: this requires strong magnetic fields, and the most common form of MRI machine used today creates these fields by passing electrical currents through liquid helium-cooled superconducting coils \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, you will be using an application of **Ampère's law** to measure the local magnetic field due to the earth. You will investigate **Faraday's law** next week in Lab 8.\n",
